I have added a separate file named bdswiss-task-db.wpress. This is the database which can be imported as a separate file in the Wordpress using the All-in-One WP Migration plugin.

Also you can find another file named bdswiss-Test.wpress which is the whole wordpress test. Again this can be imported using All-in-One WP Migration plugin if needed.

Thank you
